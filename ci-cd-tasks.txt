The intended goal for the CI-CD would be to automate the build process and deployment of hims-dev and hims-desktop



hims-dev ci
1. run copy_clone_to_dev.sh
2. cd to hims-app-dev
3. run 
   yarn run build
hims-dev cd
4. if no errors on number 3 then run 
   publish.sh
5. run build-to-s3.sh



hims-desktop ci
1. run autopull_hims-app-dev.sh
2. cd to hims-app-dev
3. run 
   yarn run build
hims-desktop cd
4. if no errors on number 3 then run 
   publish.sh
5. run build-to-s3.sh


ToDo's

- incorporate the cypress test-runner during the CI processes. 
- incorporate a GitLab variable that will set the version number from GitLab , save it to environment via exports, and the package.json will read it from environment
- modify package.json to use config files for dev, uat, client-uat, and client-prod
- determine when it will run (file commit, or merge, or ...)
